The Telemedicine Appointment Scheduler is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to transform the way patients interact with medical professionals. In today’s fast-paced world, timely and accessible medical care is essential—especially in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. This system bridges that gap by enabling secure, efficient, and intelligent virtual consultations.
Through the integration of modern technologies such as WebRTC for real-time video communication, machine learning for personalized doctor recommendations, and cloud infrastructure for scalable deployment, the platform offers a comprehensive solution for remote medical services. Patients can book appointments, consult doctors, receive prescriptions, and manage medical records—all through a single, user-friendly interface.
The system supports a wide range of features including family account management, multilingual access, digital payments, and role-based access control, ensuring that it caters to diverse user needs while maintaining high standards of privacy and data security.
In essence, this project aims to enhance healthcare accessibility, reduce physical barriers to consultation, and offer a reliable, AI-assisted medical experience to users across various demographics.
